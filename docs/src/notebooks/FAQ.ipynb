    "\n",
    "+ There no are missing values (except possibly for Gaussian traits where we impute them with the mean). \n",
    "+ when running sparse linear regression, phenotypes should be approximately Gaussian\n",

    "\n",
    "## When to standardize covariates?\n",

    "\n",
    "For binary PLINK files (.bed/.bim/.fam) standardization is automatic. When using wrapper functions [cross_validate()](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelIHT.jl/latest/man/api/#MendelIHT.cross_validate) and [iht()](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelIHT.jl/latest/man/api/#MendelIHT.iht), non-genetic covariate will also be automatically standardized. However using internal functions [fit_iht()](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelIHT.jl/latest/man/api/#MendelIHT.iht) and [cv_iht()](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelIHT.jl/latest/man/api/#MendelIHT.cv_iht) bypasses standardization and is generally recommended only if wrapper functions do not work for your purposes. \n",
